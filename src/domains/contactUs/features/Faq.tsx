              How does Barchinet work?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Clients post their project details, including budget, timeline,
              and design preferences. Architects submit proposals, and clients
              can review portfolios, negotiate terms, and select the architect
              that best fits their vision. The platform ensures transparency
              through digital contracts and project supervisors who oversee
              each stage.
